Proxy Design Pattern:
A bank's heque or credit card is a proxy for what is in our bank account. It can be used in place of cash,
and provides a means of accessing that cash when required. And that’s exactly what the Proxy pattern does
– “Controls and manage access to the object they are protecting“.
